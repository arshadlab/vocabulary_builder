What are your intentions ?

619
00:47:15,155 --> 00:47:18,886
Huh ? l mean, just to, uh,

620
00:47:18,959 --> 00:47:22,326
make little dramas in coffee shops,
turn a woman's head ?

621
00:47:22,396 --> 00:47:25,229
l don't mind admitting
that my-my head was turned.

622
00:47:25,299 --> 00:47:27,699
l-l liked it.

623
00:47:27,768 --> 00:47:32,705
But, well, ten hours later,
l feel like a fool.

624
00:47:33,774 --> 00:47:36,208
l just don't get it.
l don't.

625
00:47:36,276 --> 00:47:38,574
You, my father,
here in this house. lt's, uh--

626
00:47:38,645 --> 00:47:42,604
lt's upsetting me, and l--

627
00:47:42,683 --> 00:47:46,642
What happened to that sweet guy
from the coffee shop ?

628
00:47:47,921 --> 00:47:49,855
Who are you, anyway ?

629
00:47:51,291 --> 00:47:55,284
And... what are you eating ?

630
00:47:56,730 --> 00:47:58,664
Peanut butter.

631
00:48:01,468 --> 00:48:03,402
Hmm.

632
00:48:03,470 --> 00:48:05,404
But it's gone now.

633
00:48:11,178 --> 00:48:13,112
Wh-- No. Please.

634
00:48:15,215 --> 00:48:18,412
- You act like you've never
had peanut butter before.
- l haven't.

635
00:48:19,853 --> 00:48:22,617
- What kind of childhood did you have ?
- Do you love Drew ?

636
00:48:22,689 --> 00:48:24,816
Excuse me ?

637
00:48:24,891 --> 00:48:27,860
When you put your mouth to his,
it seemed a frequent thing.

638
00:48:30,597 --> 00:48:32,690
Drew is none of your business,

639
00:48:32,766 --> 00:48:35,462
and neither is where l put my mouth.

640
00:48:35,535 --> 00:48:37,833
l'm sorry.
Do you live here ?

641
00:48:37,904 --> 00:48:40,930
No, Joe, l'm swimming here
and now l'm going home.

642
00:48:41,007 --> 00:48:44,204
Yes, l think what
l'm trying to say is,

643
00:48:44,277 --> 00:48:46,939
l would like it
if we were friends.

644
00:48:47,013 --> 00:48:49,641
l've got plenty of friends.

645
00:48:49,716 --> 00:48:52,378
l don't have any.

646
00:48:54,588 --> 00:48:56,988
Well, l can see why.

647
00:49:03,964 --> 00:49:06,364
l didn't mean
to offend you at dinner.

648
00:49:06,433 --> 00:49:08,765
l'm sometimes...

649
00:49:08,835 --> 00:49:12,635
not quite at home around people.

650
00:49:14,574 --> 00:49:18,032
l get busy doing,
uh, what it is l do.

651
00:49:18,111 --> 00:49:22,138
And l don't seem
to have developed--

652
00:49:25,185 --> 00:49:27,346
Yes ?

653
00:49:31,425 --> 00:49:37,227
l have a certain function to perform,
and it seems to take up most of my time.

654
00:49:38,565 --> 00:49:42,501
But sometimes l... speculate...

655
00:49:45,005 --> 00:49:47,371
that l haven't left room for...

656
00:49:50,310 --> 00:49:52,710
anything else.

657
00:49:56,183 --> 00:49:58,117
Hmm.

658
00:49:59,619 --> 00:50:01,951
l'm sorry to say
l know what you mean.

659
00:50:14,968 --> 00:50:16,902
Well, um--

660
00:50:19,873 --> 00:50:21,807
Good night, Joe.

661
00:50:21,875 --> 00:50:24,309
Yes.

662
00:50:24,377 --> 00:50:27,418
Good night to you, Susan.

663
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:31,980
- Morning, Madeline.
- Oh, good morning, Mr. Parrish.

664
00:50:32,056 --> 00:50:34,616
- Everything okay ?
- Yes, sir.

665
00:50:34,692 --> 00:50:36,626
Good.

666
00:50:54,011 --> 00:50:56,309
Morning.

667
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:58,712
Good morning, Bill.

668
00:51:04,288 --> 00:51:06,984
What's on the docket
for today ?

669
00:51:07,057 --> 00:51:11,687
- Docket ?
- Hmm, yes. What shall we do ?

670
00:51:11,762 --> 00:51:15,630
- Well, l have to go to work, and--
- Splendid. l'll join you.

671
00:51:15,699 --> 00:51:17,667
Oh.

672
00:51:17,735 --> 00:51:20,295
[ Chuckles ]
Would you like to ride or walk ?

673
00:51:20,371 --> 00:51:22,737
Walk. l wish to see the world.

674
00:51:24,008 --> 00:51:28,638
This is crazy. This is
the left field thing of all time.

675
00:51:28,712 --> 00:51:32,239
l, uh-- l don't know if
l can get through this.

676
00:51:32,316 --> 00:51:35,547
- What do l do ?
What do l tell my family ?
- You'll get through this, Bill.

677
00:51:35,619 --> 00:51:39,146
As far as your family's concerned,
uh, l wouldn't say anything.

678
00:51:39,223 --> 00:51:42,192
You'll ruin the great start
we had last night.

679
00:51:42,259 --> 00:51:46,821
Hmm. lt felt as if
l was being treated like a person.

680
00:51:46,897 --> 00:51:48,865
Yes, Joe this, Joe that.

681
00:51:48,932 --> 00:51:53,096
A nice smile.
Quince passed me the rolls.

682
00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:58,198
No passion or rapture
or any of these mighty things
you're so intent on imparting.

683
00:51:58,275 --> 00:52:00,368
But l am certain,

684
00:52:00,444 --> 00:52:03,641
should you say who l am,
our adventure would end abruptly.

685
00:52:03,714 --> 00:52:06,148
Mm-hmm.

686
00:52:09,553 --> 00:52:11,612
And l did so enjoy your family.

687
00:52:15,059 --> 00:52:18,859
What about my family ?
This adventure involves only me, right ?

688
00:52:18,929 --> 00:52:21,830
What do you mean ?

689
00:52:25,169 --> 00:52:28,400
l'll tell you what.
You promise this undertaking of yours...

690
00:52:28,472 --> 00:52:30,440
involves only me and, uh--

691
00:52:30,507 --> 00:52:32,941
And what ?

692
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:35,706
- l won't tell anyone who you are.
- Sounds fair enough.

693
00:52:35,779 --> 00:52:39,044
Good. ls it a deal ?

694
00:52:39,116 --> 00:52:41,778
- A deal ?
- Yeah.

695
00:52:41,852 --> 00:52:44,844
You give your word;
l give mine that we'll do what we say.

696
00:52:44,922 --> 00:52:48,722
- Mm-hmm.
- lt is a truth exchanged
between two people.

697
00:52:48,792 --> 00:52:50,885
- Bill ?
- What ?

698
00:52:50,961 --> 00:52:54,089
You have a deal. Ow !

699
00:53:00,671 --> 00:53:03,265
That's great.

700
00:53:06,043 --> 00:53:08,204
Great.

701
00:53:08,278 --> 00:53:11,975
You know, l got to thinking.

702
00:53:12,049 --> 00:53:16,213
With you here and seemingly occupied,

703
00:53:16,286 --> 00:53:19,312
how's your work going,
l mean, elsewhere ?

704
00:53:19,390 --> 00:53:23,258
While you were shaving this morning,
you weren't just shaving.

705
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:26,660
- What do you mean ?
- You were hatching ideas,

706
00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:29,699
making plans,
arriving at decisions, right ?

707
00:53:29,767 --> 00:53:31,735
Yeah, l guess so.

708
00:53:31,802 --> 00:53:35,533
So you understand the concept. While
part of you is busy doing one thing,

709
00:53:35,606 --> 00:53:40,236
another part of you is
doing another, perhaps even attending
to the problems of your work.

710
00:53:40,310 --> 00:53:43,177
- Correct ?
- Of course.

711
00:53:43,247 --> 00:53:46,944
So you understand the idea.
Congratulations, Bill.

712
00:53:47,017 --> 00:53:50,214
Now multiply that by infinity,
take that to the depths of forever,

713
00:53:50,287 --> 00:53:52,983
and you still will barely have
a glimpse of what l'm talking about.

714
00:53:53,056 --> 00:53:55,616
[ Horn Honking ]

715
00:53:59,897 --> 00:54:02,422
- Joe ?
- Yes, Bill ?

716
00:54:05,135 --> 00:54:07,569
How about giving
a guy a break ?

717
00:54:07,638 --> 00:54:09,629
Make an exception ?

718
00:54:09,706 --> 00:54:13,107
- Well, there's one to every rule.
- Not this.

719
00:54:13,177 --> 00:54:16,169
And call my family. l'd like them
to have dinner with me tonight.

720
00:54:16,246 --> 00:54:19,511
Didn't the family
get together last night ?

721
00:54:19,583 --> 00:54:23,952
- Jennifer.
- Of course, Mr. Parrish, right away.

722
00:54:24,021 --> 00:54:26,922
- Uh, perhaps you'd like
to wait in my office.
- No.

723
00:54:26,990 --> 00:54:30,892
What l'm trying to say is this is
a board meeting and you're not a member.

724
00:54:30,961 --> 00:54:34,658
- l'm sure you'll find a way
to make it all right.
- [ Sighs ]

725
00:54:34,731 --> 00:54:37,825
Nice to meet you.

726

Morning.

727
00:54:39,937 --> 00:54:41,905
[ All ]
Good morning.

728
00:54:44,341 --> 00:54:46,366
Thank you. Eddie.

729
00:54:46,443 --> 00:54:48,775
Uh, this is Joe Black.

730
00:54:48,846 --> 00:54:53,874
- He's a personal associate
of mine, and, uh--
- Hello, Quince.

731
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:56,419
- Hey.
- [ Bill ] He'll be
joining us this morning.

732
00:54:56,487 --> 00:55:00,753
l know this is unusual,
and my apologies, and, uh--

733
00:55:00,824 --> 00:55:03,725
- Drew, carry on.
- [ Drew ] lt's nice to see you.

734
00:55:03,794 --> 00:55:06,957
Didn't expect you, but, uh--

735
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:09,089
certainly you can't get
enough of a good thing.

736
00:55:09,166 --> 00:55:12,727
- Thank you.
- Joe, would you like to sit there ?

737
00:55:12,803 --> 00:55:15,533
[ Chewing ]

738
00:55:24,381 --> 00:55:26,349
Okay.

739
00:55:26,416 --> 00:55:30,910
Uh, the Board of Parrish Communications
is hereby called to order.

740
00:55:30,988 --> 00:55:32,956
Our sole order of--

741
00:55:38,695 --> 00:55:41,459
Our s--

742
00:55:48,672 --> 00:55:51,334
Our sole order
of business today is a, uh--

743
00:55:51,408 --> 00:55:54,605
is an acceptance of
John Bontecou's generous offer.

744
00:55:54,678 --> 00:55:57,579
- And l think Bill--
- Do you have any more
of these delicious cookies ?

745
00:55:57,648 --> 00:55:59,912
The jelly ones ?

746
00:55:59,983 --> 00:56:02,213
Mmm, and a cup of tea.

747
00:56:02,286 --> 00:56:07,223
With milk, l think.
l'd like to try it English style. Yes.

748
00:56:07,291 --> 00:56:09,259
[ Joe ]
A cup of tea with milk, please.

749
00:56:09,326 --> 00:56:11,487
ls there anything else,
Mr. Black ?

750
00:56:11,562 --> 00:56:13,928
- How about some water ?
- Why, yes, thank you.

751
00:56:13,997 --> 00:56:15,931
- Hot or cold ?
- Cold.

752
00:56:15,999 --> 00:56:19,935
- And a glass ?
- Mmm.

753
00:56:23,974 --> 00:56:28,638
Uh, to review. We're really crossing
the T's and dotting the l's here.

754
00:56:28,712 --> 00:56:32,580
Uh, Bill had a great and conclusive
meeting yesterday with John Bontecou,

755
00:56:32,649 --> 00:56:35,641
and all that remains for us
is to put it to a vote.

756
00:56:38,322 --> 00:56:42,918
Um, thank you. Drew, um--

757
00:56:44,227 --> 00:56:46,525
[ Chuckles ]
Yeah.

758
00:56:46,597 --> 00:56:49,498
l did enjoy, or rather
l was interested...

759
00:56:49,566 --> 00:56:53,969
in meeting John Bontecou yesterday,

760
00:56:54,037 --> 00:56:56,164
and, um--

761
00:56:57,774 --> 00:57:02,609
lmpressive, l suppose.

762
00:57:02,679 --> 00:57:04,613
But, uh--

763
00:57:08,518 --> 00:57:11,009
But--

764
00:57:11,088 --> 00:57:14,546
lt did get me to thinking.

765
00:57:16,226 --> 00:57:20,458
See, l started in this business
because this is what l wanted to do.

766
00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:25,092
l knew l wasn't gonna write
the great American novel.

767
00:57:25,168 --> 00:57:28,467
But l also knew there was more to life
than buying something for a dollar...

768
00:57:28,538 --> 00:57:31,439
and selling it for two.

769
00:57:31,508 --> 00:57:35,000
l'd hoped to create something,
something which could be...

770
00:57:35,078 --> 00:57:38,047
held to the highest standards.

771
00:57:38,115 --> 00:57:42,017
And what l realized was l--

772
00:57:42,085 --> 00:57:45,418
l wanted to give

And not only will you have
to pay him to do this,

far more important,
you'll have to agree with him.

Reporting the news is
a privilege and a responsibility.

And it is not exploitable.

Looks like l'm reversing my field.

That's your privilege, Bill.
But given our needs,

given the absolute necessity
for growth, given the future,

the truth is, joining John Bontecou is
every bit as certain as death and taxes.

[ Breathes Heavily ]

926
01:09:10,741 --> 01:09:15,178
with a little white collar
that had a little...

927
01:09:15,245 --> 01:09:18,373
red piping on it.

928
01:09:21,785 --> 01:09:24,015
- [ Knocking ]
- Yeah ?

929
01:09:26,223 --> 01:09:28,623
Hi.

- Am l interrupting ?
- Yes.

931
01:09:34,097 --> 01:09:36,793
- No.
- Just kidding ?

932
01:09:36,867 --> 01:09:40,234
[ Bill ]
Sit down, Drew.

933
01:09:40,304 --> 01:09:44,832
Uh, before l do, l was hoping
we might be alone, Bill.

934
01:09:44,908 --> 01:09:48,071
Well, Joe and l have
no secrets from each other.

935
01:09:48,145 --> 01:09:50,079
[ Drew ]
How nice for you both.

936
01:09:54,718 --> 01:09:58,245
Pardon my candor, but l was confounded
by your decision this morning.

937
01:09:58,322 --> 01:10:00,347
- Why ?
- l was hired.

938
01:10:00,424 --> 01:10:04,360
You told me to help bring Parrish
Communications into the 21st century.

939
01:10:04,428 --> 01:10:07,192
- This merger is the vehicle.
ln my estimation--
- Perhaps a merger is a way...

940
01:10:07,264 --> 01:10:10,563
to bring Bill's company into
the 21st century, and perhaps it isn't.

941
01:10:10,634 --> 01:10:13,728
And perhaps cheating
on your French philosophers exam
at the Groton School...

942
01:10:13,804 --> 01:10:17,433
was an expedient way to get
your diploma, and perhaps it wasn't.

943
01:10:17,507 --> 01:10:23,002
Be that as it may, Drew, a question
can often be argued both ways.

944
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:25,674
Joe, cut it out.
You too, Drew.

945
01:10:28,552 --> 01:10:32,648
- l thought this was
practically a done deal.
- Well, now it's undone, okay ?

946
01:10:32,723 --> 01:10:35,851
Forget Bontecou.
Scrub him.

947
01:10:35,926 --> 01:10:39,418
l'm tired of his fancy name
and his fancy offer.

948
01:10:39,496 --> 01:10:42,761
l'm not going for it.

949
01:10:42,833 --> 01:10:45,529
Okay.

950
01:10:54,378 --> 01:10:57,404
Bill, why at this juncture...

951
01:10:57,481 --> 01:11:00,712
are you letting yourself be
so concerned by business matters ?

952
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:05,782
'Cause l don't want anybody
buying up my life's work !

Turning it into something
it wasn't meant to be.

954
01:11:08,759 --> 01:11:13,219
A man wants to leave
something behind. He wants it
left behind the way he made it.

955
01:11:13,296 --> 01:11:15,321
He wants it to be run
the way he ran it,

956
01:11:15,399 --> 01:11:17,924
with a sense of honor,
of dedication, of truth.

957
01:11:18,001 --> 01:11:20,629
Easy, Bill. You'll give
yourself a heart attack...

958
01:11:20,704 --> 01:11:23,798
and ruin my vacation.

959
01:11:41,391 --> 01:11:43,450
Now listen.

960
01:11:43,527 --> 01:11:45,995
l read you all the way
on the Bontecou thing,

961
01:11:46,062 --> 01:11:49,998
and l know where you're coming from,
and l am with you 101 percent.

962
01:11:50,066 --> 01:11:52,933
Well, thank you, Quince.

963
01:11:55,472 --> 01:11:57,633
But l just gotta tell you,

964
01:11:57,707 --> 01:12:00,198
if mergers are in the wind,

965
01:12:00,277 --> 01:12:03,940
l've developed some great prospects.

966
01:12:04,014 --> 01:12:06,847
And l want to come and talk to you
about-- about 'em next week.

967
01:12:06,917 --> 01:12:09,147
- Next week ?
- Yeah.

968
01:12:10,353 --> 01:12:13,516
Or the week after.

969
01:12:15,125 --> 01:12:18,356
- No good ?
- No. Why, anything's possible.

970
01:12:18,428 --> 01:12:21,864
- lt's up to Joe.
- [ Exhales ] Joe.

971
01:12:21,932 --> 01:12:24,799
You just don't know
how glad l am you're aboard,

972
01:12:24,868 --> 01:12:27,462
because anybody who can take
some of the weight off the old man,

973
01:12:27,537 --> 01:12:30,870
l am-- l'm in his corner.

974
01:12:30,941 --> 01:12:35,310
- That's very gracious of you, Quince.
- Ah, it's no problem.

975
01:12:35,378 --> 01:12:39,314
Well, l'll leave you two alone,
because l can, uh--

976
01:12:39,382 --> 01:12:41,850
l can tell, you know--

Now, look,
l know you're down.

But you know, when you're down,
there's no place to go but up.

Up. Thanks, Quince.

981
01:12:58,835 --> 01:13:00,803
Forget about Bontecou.

merger possibilities up my sleeve,

983

to the old man.

The timing has gotta be right,

because the old man
says it's up to Joe.

989
01:13:24,194 --> 01:13:26,128
- He said it's up to Joe ?
- Mm-hmm.

01:13:26,196 --> 01:13:28,960
- Those were his words ?
- Yeah.

- lt's up to Joe, huh ?
- Yeah.

- That's what he said ?
- That's what he-- That's what he said.

from John Bontecou.

Not only is he still interested,
he's sweetening his offer.

1155
01:25:32,751 --> 01:25:35,311
Although it pains me
to say it, in my opinion,

1156
01:25:35,387 --> 01:25:39,221
Bill Parrish dealt with us
preemptively...

1157

in dismissing any deal
with Bontecou.

1158
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:46,556
Therefore, l'm sorry to say
that if we're to examine
this new offer responsibly,

01:25:46,632 --> 01:25:49,726

of Parrish Communications,

There's one additional element.

Bontecou is so anxious to get us,

- Sure.
- Joe knows the whole story. l told him.

And it was his idea
that l come clean. l mean--

You wanna know ?
l'll tell you.

1713

You're looking at a man
who is not walking through
the valley of the shadow of death.

He's galloping into it. At the

has been commandeered by

- l think you heard me, Bill.

does that mean, anyway ? We had a deal.

Susan's my daughter.
She has a wonderful life ahead of her.

1724

and you're telling me you're sorry ?

to take whatever you want
because it pleases you.

1729

That's not love.

Then what is it ?

1731
02:18:48,920 --> 02:18:53,482
Some aimless infatuation which,
for the moment, you feel like indulging.

1732
02:18:53,558 --> 02:18:56,118
lt's missing everything
that matters.

1733
02:18:56,194 --> 02:18:58,025
Which is what ?

1734
02:18:58,096 --> 02:19:00,758
Trust, responsibility,

1735
02:19:00,832 --> 02:19:02,766
taking the weight for
your choices and feelings...

1736
02:19:02,834 --> 02:19:05,428
and spending the rest of your life
living up to them,

1737
02:19:05,503 --> 02:19:09,234
and above all,
not hurting the object of your love.

1738
02:19:09,307 --> 02:19:11,537
So that's love according
to William Parrish ?

1739
02:19:11,609 --> 02:19:14,669
Multiply it by infinity and take it
to the depth of forever,

1740
02:19:14,746 --> 02:19:18,409
and you will still have barely a glimpse
of what l'm talking about.

1741
02:19:18,483 --> 02:19:22,214
- Those were my words.
- They're mine now.

1742
02:19:22,286 --> 02:19:27,588
Bill, Susan wants
to come with me. She loves me.

1743
02:19:27,658 --> 02:19:29,683
- She loves you ?
- Mm-hmm.

1744
02:19:29,761 --> 02:19:32,195
Who is you ?
Did you tell her who you are ?

1745
02:19:32,263 --> 02:19:36,597
-No.
-Does she know where she's going ? Huh ?

1746
02:19:38,369 --> 02:19:41,338
You see, Susan went for
that poor son of a bitch...

1747
02:19:41,405 --> 02:19:44,533
whose body you took,
and everything since has been aftermath.

1748
02:19:44,609 --> 02:19:46,577
You don't know what love is.

1749

She doesn't know who you are.

1750
02:19:48,646 --> 02:19:52,912
You make a deal; you're breaking it.
Bottom line is, Joe,

1751
02:19:52,984 --> 02:19:55,680
you're swindling her soul, and you're
doing it with your eyes wide open.

1752
02:19:55,753 --> 02:19:59,211
- l don't like what you're saying.
- l'm past caring
what you like and don't.

1753
02:19:59,290 --> 02:20:01,986
- You're stealing my daughter,
and l'm not gonna let you.
- You're not ?

1754
02:20:02,059 --> 02:20:04,220
- No.
- Are you threatening me ?

1755
02:20:04,295 --> 02:20:07,093
Yeah, l certainly hope so.

1756
02:20:07,165 --> 02:20:09,099
Yeah.

1757
02:20:11,369 --> 02:20:15,863
l loved Susan from the moment
she was born, and l love her now
and every minute in between.

1758
02:20:15,940 --> 02:20:19,933
And what l dream of
is a man who will discover her,
and that she will discover a man...

1759
02:20:20,011 --> 02:20:23,970
who will love her,
who is worthy of her,
who is of this world, this time...

1760
02:20:24,048 --> 02:20:26,312
and has the grace, compassion
and fortitude to walk beside her...

1761
02:20:26,384 --> 02:20:28,318
as she makes her way
through life.

and what l want is Susan.

And l will have her,
and she will have me.

And that's the way it's going to be.
And there's nothing you can do.

Why did you tell me all this, Joe ?

You're the big shot,
the biggest shot of all.

but that's what you're doing.
Do you know why ?

1769
02:20:54,278 --> 02:20:58,339
Because you've somehow

try it out, see what happens ?

You're the poison, Drew.

my experience to encounter.

stoically and selflessly,
without revealing my identity.

Had he violated

have been far easier.

He could have turned
defeat into victory.

But he is too honorable a man
to have done that.

Because of me, he has lost his work,
his company, his reputation.

has structured his mergers

in suspicious and complicated ways
so as to evade paying the taxes
he is liable for.

The agency asked Bill for
his cooperation in an undercover
investigation of Bontecou.
